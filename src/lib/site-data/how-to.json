    "steps": [
      { "title": "Check Your Internet Speed", "description": "Buffering is most often caused by a slow or unstable internet connection. Run a speed test. For stable HD and 4K streaming, we recommend a minimum consistent download speed of <strong>25-30 Mbps</strong>." },
      { "title": "Restart Your Devices", "description": "This is a simple but highly effective solution. Power cycle your streaming device (Fire TV, Android box, etc.) and your internet router by unplugging them for 60 seconds before plugging them back in. This clears their temporary cache and can resolve many connectivity problems." },
      { "title": "Use a Wired Ethernet Connection", "description": "Wi-Fi signals can be unstable due to interference from other devices or distance from the router. Whenever possible, connect your streaming device directly to your router using an Ethernet cable. This provides the most stable and reliable connection, which is crucial for high-quality streaming." },
      { "title": "Use a VPN Service", "description": "Internet Service Providers (ISPs) sometimes intentionally slow down (or 'throttle') IPTV traffic, causing buffering. Using a reliable VPN can encrypt your traffic, hiding it from your ISP and bypassing these restrictions. This is often the most effective solution for buffering that occurs during peak hours." },
      { "title": "Clear the App's Cache", "description": "Over time, your IPTV app can accumulate a large cache which can slow it down. Go to your device's settings, find your installed IPTV app, and select the 'Clear Cache' option.

    "faqs": [
      { "question": "Why does my IPTV only seem to buffer at night?", "answer": "This is a classic sign of network congestion or ISP throttling. During peak hours (typically evenings), ISPs may slow down streaming video traffic to manage their network load. Using a VPN is the most effective way to solve this specific issue." },
      { "question": "Will a faster internet plan fix buffering issues?", "answer": "Not always. While a minimum speed is required, having an extremely fast plan (e.g., 1 Gbps) won't help if the underlying problem is an unstable Wi-Fi connection or your ISP is throttling your speeds. A stable connection is more important than raw speed." }

      { "question": "Why is my MAG box stuck on the 'Loading' screen?", "answer": "This is a very common issue that almost always means one of two things: either the portal URL was entered incorrectly, or your device's MAC address has not yet been activated on our server. First, please double-check the portal URL for any typos. If it is correct, contact our support team to verify that your MAC address has been successfully activated." },
      { "question": "Can I use an M3U link with my MAG box instead of a portal?", "answer": "No. MAG boxes are specialized devices designed to work with IPTV portals. They do not function well with M3U links. The portal method is the only one we support for these devices as it ensures a stable connection, a user-friendly interface, and a fully functional EPG (TV Guide)." }
